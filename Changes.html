Someone at some point changed vos release's force argument from -f to
-force. API calls written with one of those will not work with a vos binary
that doesn't agree on the choice of force option. This would have require
developers to write code like this:


<P>

<PRE>   $vos-&gt;release
     (
      id                =&gt; $id,
      cell              =&gt; $cell,
      ( $vos-&gt;supportsArgument('release','force') ?
        ( force         =&gt; 1 ) :
        ( f             =&gt; 1 )
      ),
     );
</PRE>

<P>

OK, that's the authors twisted way of doing it, and it seems like needless
complexity. Both f and force are now supported as options, using a simply
alias mechanism to translate from one to the other, based on what is
supported by the vos binary.


<P>

The documentation hasn't been changed, since you can use 'force' in all
cases, and since that is the newer of the two, the docs will stay as they
are. The fact that your vos binary really wants 'f' is hidden from you, and
will stay that way.

The returned object has a cell attribute, as well as the hosts attribute,
but the docs forgot to mention this.
