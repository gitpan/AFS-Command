=head2 AFS::Command::VOS->release support both -f and -force

Someone at some point changed vos release's force argument from -f to
-force.  API calls written with one of those will not work with a vos
binary that doesn't agree on the choice of force option.  This would
have require developers to write code like this:

   $vos->release
     (
      id		=> $id,
      cell		=> $cell,
      ( $vos->supportsArgument('release','force') ?
        ( force		=> 1 ) :
        ( f		=> 1 )
      ),
     );

OK, that's the authors twisted way of doing it, and it seems like
needless complexity.  Both f and force are now supported as options,
using a simply alias mechanism to translate from one to the other,
based on what is supported by the vos binary.

The documentation hasn't been changed, since you can use 'force' in
all cases, and since that is the newer of the two, the docs will stay
as they are.  The fact that your vos binary really wants 'f' is hidden
from you, and will stay that way.

=head2 AFS::Command::BOS->listhosts

The returned object has a cell attribute, as well as the hosts
attribute, but the docs forgot to mention this.
