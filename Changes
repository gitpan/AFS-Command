=head1 Changes in 1.4

=head1 Enhancements

=head2 Test suite is disabled by default.

There is a well intentioned effort to automatically test all new
submissions to CPAN (see http://testers.cpan.org).  Unfortunately, the
AFS-Command package can't be tested automatically, since it requires a
fair amount of configuration.  You have to specify a cell name, some
fileserver names and partitions, etc.

By default, the tests will all be skipped if the configured cell name
in the CONFIG file has not been modified, thus allowing the automated
CPAN testing to continue, automatically, without the author getting a
bunch of bogus emails.

=head1 Bugs

=head2 Volume status value inconsistency

!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!

This change is NOT backwards compatible with previous releases, so
verify that your code handles the new, consistent values correctly.

The "status" field returned from either vos->examine() or
vos->listvol(), in previous releases, had inconsistent values. When a
volume is online, the status would be one of:

    online
    On-line

Likewise, when offline, one of:

    offline
    Off-line

These values have all been normalized to: online, offline

=head2 AFS::Command::VOS->examine parses busy and offline messages

When a volume is busy or can not be attached, "vos examine" will be
unable to display the volume headers.  Instead, a one line message is
printed, such as one of the following:

    **** Volume 123456789 is busy ****
    **** Could not attach volume 123456789 ****

The examine method now parses these, and the AFS::Object::VolumeHeader
object will have only the 'id' and 'status' attributes.  Previously,
those lines were incorrectly parsed and the 'name' attribute set to
'****', which is pretty obviously wrong.
