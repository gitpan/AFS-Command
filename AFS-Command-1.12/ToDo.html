Methods like $fs-&gt;listacl() return these handy little AFS::Object::ACL
objects. It would be nice if we could manipulate them via OO method calls,
and then pass them right back to $fs-&gt;setacl(), wouldn't it?


<P>

And how about passing the AFS::Object::Path objects returned from
$fs-&gt;whichcell directly to an $fs-&gt;listquota call, so that the final
AFS::Object::Path objects have all of the attributes returned by both
calls, but in one set of objects?


<P>

Look for this in version 1.1

</A></H2>
stderr processing needs to be handled in the <CODE>_exec_cmds()</CODE>
method, and for that matter, <CODE>_reap_cmds()</CODE> needs to be folded
into <CODE>_exec_cmds().</CODE>


<P>

The problem is that each API method calls <CODE>_save_stderr(),</CODE> and
then later calls <CODE>_restore_stderr(),</CODE> and we leave stderr
redirected for longer than necessary. The contents of the redirected output
should be *only* the output from the commands we run, and right now, some
of our own carping can creep in there.


<P>

Worse, its possible that a failure in the API can leave stderr redirected,
resulting in a lot of confusion.


<P>

Its possible we should just suck in *ALL* of the output, both
stdout/stderr, and drop that data into a couple of arrays. Then, method
calls on the command object get gets individual rows of stdout/stderr
output.


<P>

<PRE>  return unless $self-&gt;_exec_cmds();

<P>

<PRE>  #
  # Process stdout
  #
  while ( defined($_ = $self-&gt;_stdout() ) ) {
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>  }
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>  #
  # Process stderr (in some cases, there's interesting data in here.
  # see the fs examine/diskfree and similar api calls)
  #
  while ( defined($_ = $self-&gt;_stderr() ) ) {
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>  }
</PRE>

<P>

Maybe something like that. By the time _exec_cmds returns, we have reaped
the commands, and collected *ALL* of the output into arrays in the object.

We should create several mount points and then query then all with one
lsmount method call, to verify we can parse output for multiple dirs. We
should pass in some bogus paths, too, to verify the error handling is
correct as well (that code feels dubious to me).

</A></H2>
Actually, all of the commands that parse per-path output, really. Currently
the code assumes the stderr output will appear first, which is a side
effect of the buffering. Some attempts to turn of buffering didn't change
this, and in any case, we don't want to be sensitive to this (we currently
are).


<P>

We need to process stderr first, to determine which paths had errors, and
then parse stdout. This will require the change descibred above for how we
handle stderr.
