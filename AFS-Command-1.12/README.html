AFS::Command -- An OO wrapper API for the AFS command line utilities (vos,
bos, pts, fs)


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="SUMMARY">SUMMARY

</A></H1>
This suite of perl modules implements an API for the command line utilities
for managing and using the AFS distributed file system. AFS is available as
both an Open Source product (http://www.openafs.org), as well as a
commercial version from IBM (http://www.ibm.com/software/stormgmt/afs/).


<P>

For example, AFS volumes are managed using the command line utility 'vos',
for which there is currently no programmatic API, in any language. This API
is a pure perl wrapper around the command line utility, that implements an
OO API that allows for the easy development of systems management
applications for AFS.

This module requires perl5.6 or later, as well as an installed AFS
infrastructure to work with. The code is pure perl, with no compiled
components, do it should work on any variant of UNIX (sorry, but this code
makes aggressive use of <CODE>pipe()</CODE> and <CODE>fork(),</CODE> so
porting it to Windows is gonna be painful... but then, why anyone would
want to manage their AFS infrastructure from Windows escapes me).

This module builds like almost everything else on CPAN:


<P>

<PRE>  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
</PRE>

<P>

Before running 'make test', edit the CONFIG file and follow the
instructions in the comments. Minimally, you have to specify a couple of
AFS file servers and one AFS database server against which to run the
tests, as well as a pathname in AFS where we can create mount points.


<P>

The test suite will require AFS super-user privileges, so you must either
be a member of the system:administrators protection group, or a member of
the super users list on the servers. If you don't know what that means, you
shouldn't be testing this module, so consult your AFS administrators.


<P>

See the CONFIG file for more details. Its pretty verbosely documented.


<P>

Any failure in the test suite is a cause for concern. For more verbose
output, run:


<P>

<PRE>  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
</PRE>

<P>

If you can't determine the source of the <CODE>problem(s),</CODE> send the
verbose test output, along with the output from ``perl -V'', as well as the
versions of AFS in use at your site, to the author, and I'll do my best to
figure out why things are breaking, and if you're lucky, actually fix it.

In addition to the README file (which in case you hadn't noticed, you're
reading right now), the history of changes is maintained in Changes.html.

<H1><A NAME="DOCUMENTATION">DOCUMENTATION

</A></H1>
Docs for these modules are split across several files, and will be
installed as man pages.


<P>

<PRE>  man AFS::Command
</PRE>

<P>

will provide the general overview of the API, its basic design. The details
of the API calls, their arguments, and return values, are found in the
following documents:


<P>

<PRE>  man AFS::Command::Base
  man AFS::Command::VOS
  man AFS::Command::BOS
  man AFS::Command::PTS
  man AFS::Command::FS
  man AFS::Object
</PRE>

Feedback, patches, recommendations, adulations, and even flames are all
welcome. Feed my ego (or try to shoot it down :-), please...
